Hi!
I'm Kushal from Telangana.
I'm currently pursuing Data Science and Artificial Intelligence in IIT Madras.
My hobbies include watching movies, listening to music and finding new things oon the internet.

The thing I most like about Git is its practical usage, keeping in track of the code is such a clutch. It helps you to be clear on your work and can allow you to experiment other things without losing track of the current work.

The python assignment I enjoyed the most is the "analysis between linear and binary search". I got to know about linear and binary search algorithms and also how to plot grapghs. I learned how efficient algorithms can be very useful when dealing with large data values.
